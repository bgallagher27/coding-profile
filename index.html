        <div>
            <p>I graduated from Suffolk University's Sawyer Business School in 2015 with a Bachelor's degree in Marketing. After some job searching I started my first post-graduation job at Enterprise Rent-A-Car in MAynard, MA. Several months later I moved into the insurance industry when I began my career at Liberty Mutual. I started in a claims adjuster role, helping guide people through auto claims. I then transitioned to a role in Loss Recovery, which is where I am today.</p>

            <p>I am currently enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp offered by Uiversity of New Hampshire's Professional Development & Training program. In this bootcamp I am looking forward to learning a great deal of new ideas and concepts, with the end goal of enabling a career transition into software development. I know the course will be hard, but I am looking forward to the challenge and the rewarding outcomes!</p>
